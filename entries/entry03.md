### Learning Process
  My biggest solution to everything is writing it out. No matter what its for, I write it out. I decided to do the same for all the new Information about coding with Leaflet. At first, I had a messy folder in my IDE, but I decided to write down all of my takeaways on a google doc. This includes steps, resorces and general tips of creating maps with leaflet, and any functions or add ons you want it to have. I find things stick better when I keep rewritting it, reviewing it, or rewatching the same resource. Making this document helped me organize my information, as well as getting more familar with the workflow. My document is still under construction, but it can be viewed [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fefLc6nQL6y_yu4SGAUnliXsFcpn5lnHqkHvMBBpSg/edit?usp=sharing)
