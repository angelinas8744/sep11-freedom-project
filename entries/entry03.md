### Learning Process
  My biggest solution to everything is writing it out. No matter what its for, I write it out. I decided to do the same for all the new Information about coding with Leaflet. At first, I had a messy folder in my IDE, but I decided to write down all of my takeaways on a google doc. This includes steps, resorces and general tips of creating maps with leaflet, and any functions or add ons you want it to have. I find things stick better when I keep rewritting it, reviewing it, or rewatching the same resource. Making this document helped me organize my information, as well as getting more familar with the workflow. My document is still under construction, but it can be viewed [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fefLc6nQL6y_yu4SGAUnliXsFcpn5lnHqkHvMBBpSg/edit?usp=sharing)
  ### The Biggest Setback
  The current challange right now is gathering enough information, as well as feeling confident enough to start practice. Since Leaflet requres a active map to code on, I would first have to spend my time creating a map, then what I want it to do. I can try out differnet features such as custom markers. Being able to look at examples of websites lets me find what I like and don't like and then know what I wanna include and what code I need. But to do this, I would first need to make a base map website. I plan to have started creating this map by my next blog. I will spend the time inbetween really focusing on preparing, and building myself up to start the base. To me, Leaflet seems like dominoes. First is the map, then everything else falls in place. I also have to take into consideration trial and error. I tend to get stnervus or discouraged with errors, so feeling ready is just as important as having the material. This is the skill of patience, which coding has slowly taught me, as well as not fearing mstakes. Although I may not be the best at that as we speak, I plan on facing that bigger issue this month. Taking that leap not only applys to coding, but plenty of situations in life.
 ### What is my plan?
 1. Every monday, repeat one [tutorial](https://youtu.be/wVnimcQsuwk) to gain a consistant familiarity with the process.
 2. Continue to add to and revise my google doc, making a clear step by step to best avoid errors and intimidation.
 3. Get the base map done.
 4. Do further research on what to add to it, and how to make it interactive.

One thing you can add to leaflet is markers. These will amrk a location on your map. You can have pre-set ones, or ones added by the user.
``` var marker = L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map); var popup = marker.bindPopup('<b>Hello world!</b><br />I am a popup.'); ```
  > idea: add markers for each trainstation of bayridge blue and bustops green / red depending on the line and where its stops are.
   
 6. Possibly use content learned in class such as DOM events, if they work with the code.
 7. Look at leaflet github projects and try them out, see what features are liked and disliked, and do further research.
 8. Add and play around with them in my sandbox map.
 9. Plan out what content I want around my map, and what I want the website to look like.

> one question I have that still is unanswered is..


 I noticed in one guide you needed a a text or code editor, which I wonder what this is? They gave the example of Sublime Text, Atom Editor, or Visual Studio Code.
After researching, I noticed sublime text has to be downloaded. Is it required for coding leaflet?
