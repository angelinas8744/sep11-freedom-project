# Entry 1
##### 11/8/21

Today, is the first step into my new project. I finalized all my idea's. I set a final goal, and a way to get there.
#### The beginning.
  For starters, I have been brainstorming throught the month *what* exacty I wanted to use for my freedom project. Some people may start the other way, thinking of what they want to make first, but I did the opposite. Sometimes, you can think of a crazy cool idea, and then work your way into figuring out how to make it happen. When you look into methods, you then realize; oh no, this is harder than I thought. To avoid that, I first picked ot of the easy, medium, hard or hardest catagories. I wanted a comfortable challange, so I begain to browse the programming tools in the medium category. The first tool to catch my eye was [Matter](http://brm.io/matter-js/): 2D physics engine. This is because simply, I love physics. Although this intrest was so strong, I couldnt think of anything to do with this. The only thing was virtual labs, but there are already plenty of sites and the mode seemed too math like for my taste. Going onto less common sites than my peers, I found [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com): customizable interactive maps. I then got an idea to make an innovative website to simply maps. 
  #### But, why maps?
 - Maps are extremely important.
- Maps can be complecated and confusing
- Maps should be known by people of all ages! 
 - A simple site; easy to read as well as tips/tutorials. 
     - This can help kids learn directions and thier area
     - This is an important life skill for them to learn
     - Getting used to being independent.
   - Less time consuming for adults with a simple layout.
   - Just visually easier on you all together.
 #### What type of featues?
 Well based on my reasearch, leaflet should allow you to create custom maps of any kind. You can add custom popups of all colors and zoom in and out of your desired map, as well as scrolling and sizing. I plan to add a small tutorial as well as a small article of how to use a map, and some tips on remerbering directions and finding your way around. This can be useful for new users, and people who need the extra support.

### Learning Process pt 1.
Starting to research on how to add maps to your page, I have a general understanding of how leaflet works. I havent gone in depth yet, but the coding isnt too complex. Its all straightforward. There isnt much math compared to matter, and there isnt too much writing. Some of it is copy and pasting map links, some is commands to create a marker, or asking the user for prompts; such as where you want to go, and helping them find the way. From a begginers tutorial, I found how to add a map using leaflet. This will be my first step, then I work my way around. I plan to have my website like this:
1. Directions / intro; what this is and how to use it **(top)**
2. How to read a map, and your surroundings in the real world (Small paragraph)
3. A world leaflet map
4. a small weather map???? or second map????
5. some tips , tricks and advice. **(bottom)**
  - Background; warm light yellow (#FAEE84)   or leafy green. (#44DB5B)
I will have to use Javascript, HTML and CSS. I will have to start off from scratch in css however. First, you have to paste this into css. This prepares your page, and should be done before writing any code.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css"
   integrity="sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A=="
   crossorigin=""/>
 ```
 Followed by this in Java.
 ```
  <!-- Make sure you put this AFTER Leaflet's CSS -->
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js"
   integrity="sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA=="
   crossorigin=""></script>
  ```
  I wont go too deep into this yet, as im still reading articles, trying it out, and watching video's. I at least know my starting point, and how to build up from there. Below are the links to my current guides.
