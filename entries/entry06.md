## Overview

Now that my freedom project has been completed, The time has come to show it off. Which leads me to my biggest challenge, shyness. I have always been extremely shy and anxious since I was a toddler. As I grew up, Things got worse. I am working really hard everyday to push myself and achieve new things. I am not letting it hold me back anymore and I have done many things this year that my old self wouldn't do- including presenting to judges in a SEP expo.
## Showcase
It is time for my first showcase. I haven't done this ever. This is my first year back from the pandemic. I felt lots of things, but I knew I would feel accomplished afterwards. The mix of nerves and excitement and anticipation was keeping me on my toes. The goal of this event is to show off your year-long work to judges and guests and have feedback and winners- who will later present in a school assembly. (so glad I didn't win!)
## Before
Not only did I have to physically prepare, I also had to mentally. I wanted to work on my presentation, but also keep my stress levels low. I had lots of other things to focus on too, so I didn't want to become too overwhelmed. First, I created my slides. I kept them brief, but not too brief incase I forget what to say. Next, I worked on my brief- two minute presentation. Below, you will see my planning process.

Hello, My name is Angelina and I made a map using Leaflet, a JavaScript library. My goal was to make a simple map for anyone to use.

The code for leaflet is straightforward, you pick out the map you want and you can customize it and add features you would like. It works as building blocks

My map can be zoomed in by using the buttons provided in the corner, or by double clicking. You can move around by clicking and dragging.

I added Markers to save coordinates, and labeled them with text. These are the default markers.

I created a custom marker with an image from google, and you can click it to toggle text.

Bye, thank you.

I wanted to keep it easy to remember, because I tend to rush or forget when I get nervous presenting. I wrote to be simple so I would be able to explain as I interacted with the website. I wrote one brief sentence for each feature, and in the easiest order to present. I decided not to over practice, because remembering the "script" can make me too focused on perfection. I practiced more with the website, and studying the basic explanations and code of my project. I wanted to keep it as natural as possible to reduce the amount of things to remember for the day.
I was somewhat nervous on arrival, so I made sure to get there on time. However, security was an issue for my friends so I went in with the bus kids without a problem. Perfect timing!
### After
I was really proud of myself for speaking loud, clear and confidently. I made sure to not rush and to act natural. After all, nobody knows this project more than me. The first presentation was somewhat scary, I felt myself growing red and stumbling on my thoughts. However, I quickly broke into routine and grew confident as more people checked out my project. On Top of that, all the positive feedback, and environment made me feel more comfortable.
Takeaways
I am not the type of person to initiate conversations or call people over, So I might work on being more approachable, since I can look serious or avoid eye contact or people in general.
Things take practice.
Not everything is as bad as it seems.
## Presentations
Next, I had to present my freedom project to the class.
Process
After the showcase, this felt so easy. I was very confident in my in class presentation. We had to create slides which explain our project, while also having a demo of it. The show had to have a hook, explanation and analysis. Overall, I summed up my project well, and did a great job presenting. Another check mark for me!
To start off, I made my slides in order of How I worked. Then, I re-ordered them in the most logical for my audience to follow and learn from. Finally, I made my slides decorated and visually pleasing.
### Takeaways
- Work on eye contact
- Try to talk slower and take my time
- Be more interactive.
## Project Improvement
- Finding a way to add JS to leaflet.

Leaflet is somewhat Limited to its features so I couldn't think of any way to incorporate loops to my code. My next step would be to figure out a way to use more JS for my map.

- Working on custom markers.

This was the hardest - and most brought up- beyond MVP extension. I tried to work on it for afew days but realized It wasn't working out and time was closing in on me. First, I created two text boxes and variables to receive and hold the X and Y coordinates for a custom marker. Then, I put the variables in the X and Y places, but there were errors with saving and placing. However, This is something I may work on in the future.

- Working with something harder.


Leaflet was a comfortable challenge. It was difficult and I was able to learn it, make the MVP and work up. However, I did not get as stuck as I expected. I am thankful, but next time I would like to push myself further and do a more complex project.

## Achievements and Growth.
I am very proud of how far I came this year. Pushing through all of the challenges, while juggling all my classes, personal life and pandemic. Onto that- last year was tough and I felt like giving up on the course. The year was better, but I had moments of discouragement too. However, I always gave my best effort- no matter how I was feeling and tried to push myself past any challenges along the way. I was able to ask for help, google efficiently, and make my freedom project how I imagined. Despite being intimidated at first, looking back at myself from September, I came a long way.

I would like to continue to grow and use these skills, even moving away from the CS field. I want to better memorize the way JS works and practice solving my own bugs and errors, spotting mistakes and being a better presenter. I want to improve my problem solving skills- findling many solutions, and creativity.
Thank you for following me on this Freedom Project Journey.
