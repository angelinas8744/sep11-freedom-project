## Overview
  Now that my freedom project has been completed, The time has come to show it off. Which leads me to my biggest challage, shyness. I have always been extremely shy and anxious since I was a toddler. As I grew up, Thinks got worse. I am working really hard everyday to push myself and achieve new things. I am not letting it hold me back anymore and I have done many things this year that my old self wouldnt do- including presenting to judges in a SEP expo.

### Showcase 

Now, my first showcase. I havent done this ever. This is my first year back from the pandemic. I felt lots of things, but I knew I would feel acomplished afterwards. The mix of nerves and excitement and antisipation was keeping me on my toes.

#### Before
Not only did I have to physically prepare, I also had to mentally. I wanted to work on my presentation, but also keep my stress levels low. I had lots of other things to focus on too, so I didnt wnat to become too overwhelmed. First, I created my slides. I kept them brief, but not too brief incase I forget what to say. Next, I worked on my brief- two minute presentation. Below, you will see my planning process.


**Hello, My name is Angelina and I made a map using Leaflet, a JavaScript library. My goal was to make a simple map for anyone to use.**

**The code for leaflet is straightforward, you pick out the map you want  and you can customize it and add features you would like. It works as building blocks**

**My map can be zoomed in by using the buttons provided in the corner, or by double clicking. You can move around by clicking and dragging.**

**I added Markers to save coordinates, and labeled them with text. These are the default markers. **

**I created a custom marker with an image from google, and you can click it to toggle text.**

**Bye, thank you.****

## Do Nexts
- Finding a way to add JS to leaflet. 

Leaflet is somewhat Limited to its features so I couldnt think of any way to inpcooporate loops to my code. My next step would be to figure out a way to use more JS for my map.

- Working on custom markers.

This was the hardest - and most brought up- beyond MVP extention. I tried to work on it for afew days but realized It wasnt working out and time was closing in on me. First, I created two text boxes and varibles to recive and hold the X and Y coordnates for a custom marker. Then, I put the varibles in the X and Y places, but there was errors with saving and placing. However, This is something I may work on in the future.

- Working with something harder.

Leaflet was a comfortable challange. It was difficult and I was able to learn it, make the MVP and work up. However, I did not get as stuck as I expected. I am thankful, but next time I would like to push myself further and do a more complex project.

## Achivements and Growth.
