- Finding a way to add JS to leaflet. 

Leaflet is somewhat Limited to its features so I couldnt think of any way to inpcooporate loops to my code. My next step would be to figure out a way to use more JS for my map.

- Working on custom markers.

This was the hardest - and most brought up- beyond MVP extention. I tried to work on it for afew days but realized It wasnt working out and time was closing in on me. First, I created two text boxes and varibles to recive and hold the X and Y coordnates for a custom marker. Then, I put the varibles in the X and Y places, but there was errors with saving and placing. However, This is something I may work on in the future.
