### Context
  The SEP11 freedom project gives me the oppurtunity to pick a coding language to create something I am passionate about. I decided on leaflet, a map making program to create a simple map website. I want to be able to help people find thier way around. I was thinking of having activities with some of its featues to help people of all ages get more famillair with thier surroundings. For example, I could have a alert to say mark all the bus stops pink, and all the train stations green, and give the user pink and green markers. Map markers are one of the features from leaflet. My goal is to create a website to support the user to feel comfortable and aware of where they are. Maps can be comfusing, and current sites can be complicated.

### What have I been working on ?
  On mondays, I have been reading and watching tutorials, mainly I try to stick with the same or simmilar sorces so I can memorize or reconize the code better. Seeing the repeating video's or articles is like studying for me. I have a good idea of how to create a base map because of this. To me, I think its important to start small, get good at that first, and then work my way up and bigger. I am currently working on reviewing how to create the map, since there is a lot to it, I have been spending the past weeks rewatching videos and following along, getting used to the code and the workflow of the coding language. As I go back and review, I know whats the next step, which helps me feel more confident and prepared for when its time to actually start. The start is most important because without a working map, set up correctly, you wont be able to do anything.
  
  However, I am not just sitting and watching. In my IDE, I made a planning page, which is a detailed step by step with example code.
