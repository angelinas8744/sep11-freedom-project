### Context

### What have I been working on ?
  On mondays, I have been reading and watching tutorials, mainly I try to stick with the same or simmilar sorces so I can memorize or reconize the code better. Seeing the repeating video's or articles is like studying for me. I have a good idea of how to create a base map because of this. To me, I think its important to start small, get good at that first, and then work my way up and bigger. I am currently working on reviewing how to create the map, since there is a lot to it, I have been spending the past weeks rewatching videos and following along, getting used to the code and the workflow of the coding language. As I go back and review, I know whats the next step, which helps me feel more confident and prepared for when its time to actually start. The start is most important because without a working map, set up correctly, you wont be able to do anything.
